# NotifyIconTest

# How to use
Install visual studio and clone this project. 

Once running, look in your System Tray for the (i) icon (blue with white i). 

Make sure notifications from apps are set to visible. 

Right click one of the buttons; you'll notice a mismatch between the Tray Icon and the Notification Icon on Windows 11 - on systems lower than Windows 11, no such errors were found by me.

Windows 10:
